# Solfit

## Blockchain-Powered Fitness Accountability Platform

Solfit is a blockchain-powered fitness challenge platform that allows users to participate in step-based fitness challenges, ensuring transparency, fairness, and security using Solana smart contracts where rewards are distributed on-chain, making the process trustless and tamper-proof.

## ðŸš€ Features

### ðŸ”’ Secure & Transparent

- All fitness data is validated cryptographically before syncing with the blockchain
- No centralized authorityâ€”everything is stored and verified on Solana

### ðŸŽ¯ Fitness Challenges

- Create custom step-count challenges with entry fees and rewards
- Participants must meet daily step goals to win their share of the prize pool
- Failed participants' stakes get distributed among successful ones
- Social Challenges & Private Groups: Users can create or join private groups to compete with friends or a community. Custom challenge  settings allow exclusive, invitation-based participation.

### ðŸ”„ Seamless Health Data Syncing

- Uses Google Fit API (or Health Connect for Android users) for step tracking
- Signed data ensures no cheating or spoofing

### ðŸ’° Reward Distribution

- Rewards are automatically distributed via smart contracts
- Participants who complete challenges get their stake + extra rewards from failed participants

### ðŸ“œ Solana-Powered Smart Contracts

- Smart contracts ensure tamper-proof challenge management
- Funds are held securely in on-chain escrow accounts

### ðŸ“± Mobile App

- Built using React Native for a smooth, cross-platform experience
- Users can join challenges, track progress, and withdraw rewards easily

### Blockchain Integration

- Uses Solana blockchain to ensure transparent, immutable challenge tracking
- Smart contracts handle challenge creation, participation, syncing, and rewards

## ðŸ“– How It Works

1. **Create Challenge:** Users create a challenge by setting a step goal, duration, and entry fee amount
2. **Join Challenge:** Participants join by paying the entry fee. Users can join public challenges open to everyone or private group challenges that require an invite code or admin approval.
   - **Private Groups**: Users can create exclusive fitness communities and invite friends or specific users.
4. **Sync Data:** Participants sync their step data daily using Health Connect API (Backend Verification)
5. **Track Progress:** The blockchain records progress, ensuring no cheating
6. **Withdraw Reward:** At the end of the challenge, users who completed the goal win rewards, while failed participants lose their stakes

## ðŸ”— Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### 2. Run the React Native App

```bash
yarn android
```

### 2. Run the Backend (for Steps Verification)

```bash
pnpx wrangler@latest dev
```

### 3. Deploy Smart Contracts (Rust + Anchor)

```bash
anchor build && anchor deploy
```

## ðŸ“¢ Future Enhancements

- **Fitbit API Integration** ðŸ“¡ to support more fitness tracking devices
